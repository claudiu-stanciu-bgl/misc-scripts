# Scripts

A random collection of scripts I have found useful at various points.
All written by me. Some are better tested than others, some are clearer
about their function than others, and I don't support any of them.

I accept no responsibility for the result of you running arbitrary code
I wrote for my own purposes without understanding what it's for.
